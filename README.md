{
    "database": {
        "host": "127.0.0.1:3306",
        "dbname": "weather_api_db",
        "username": "yourusername",

    }
}

Also, the API key for the Open Weather Map API will be provided in a json file called "API_KEY.json" inside the top-level directory "config".

    "API_KEY": "yourapikey"
